# Reproducible, dynamic, and elegant books with Quarto

by Mine Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel at posit::conf(2024)

Building on my experience writing books with Quarto for various audiences (R learners, statistics learners, and Quarto learners), for various venues (self-published and publisher-published), in various formats (HTML books hosted online and PDF books printed), I will share best practices and tips and tricks for authoring reproducible, dynamic, and elegant books with Quarto. I will also highlight a few features from the recent Quarto releases that pertain to books (e.g., flexible and custom cross-references, embedding computations from notebooks, and inline code in multiple languages) as well as share examples of how to make your web-hosted books more interactive with tools like webR and shinylive.

## Outline/brainstorming

- Opening: 
	- Something about pop-up books
	- Things I learned writing a book but that don't apply just to writing a book

- Three examples:

	- OpenIntro IMS2: 
		- pdf/latex things: 
			- custom divs in HTML and CSS
			- pagebreak hell (due to self-publishing) 
		- accessibility:
			- fig-alt
			- colors in light and dark themes

	- R4DS: 
		- R code things:
			- _common.R
			- ???
		- ???

	- Quarto book: 
		- embedding computations from notebooks
		- inline code in multiple languages

- Closing: Interactivity / pop-up book...

* maybe vote on order
* versioning might be nice to mention re: working in Quarto instead of Word
